# Solution for LEVEL 1:

Passing one of the two smoke circles will disable gravity and controls for the player, then the only option to move the player is to move the window.  
So the player has to pass one circle to begin floating and pass the obstacle then pass the other circle to stop floating and reach the end of level portal.
