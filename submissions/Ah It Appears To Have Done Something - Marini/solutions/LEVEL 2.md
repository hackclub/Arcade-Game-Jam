# Solution for level 2

When entering level 2 your monitor brightness will be set to zero, your visibility in the game window will be obscured and your character will be asleep with no possibility of controlling it.
To wake up the player you have to increase the brightness by at least 50 percent.

Keep in mind that due to the nature of how the program is detecting brightness changes you might have to try to modify brightness more than one time because when the operation begins all eventual monitor overlays will be closed.

After waking up your character you have to traverse the level by precisely jumping on the columns and use the jumping pad to reach the upper half of the level where the end of level portal resides.
