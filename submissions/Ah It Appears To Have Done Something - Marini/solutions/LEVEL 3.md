# Solution for level 3

The player has to travel through the level using the provided bounce pads to reach otherwise unreachable platforms.
Whe confronted with the speaker the player has to lower their system volume to zero so that the speaker high volume won't hurt the character.
The Windows API might not work, in that case the speakers will be turned off to permit reaching the end of the level.
