# Ah It Appears To Have Done Something

Made for Hack Club Jam of summer 2024, the theme is loopholes, which as stated on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loophole) are:

```
A loophole is an ambiguity or inadequacy in a system, such as a law or security, 
which can be used to circumvent or otherwise avoid the purpose,
implied or explicitly stated, of the system.
```

Name inspired by the homonymous meme (https://youtu.be/bzmIitaLMfA).

## Description

Ah It Appears To Have Done Something is a 2D puzzle platformer structured in a plethora of levels with varying mechanics, in which the player will have to find out a way to reach the end of the level by alternative means, often breaking the boundaries of the game and interacting with the hardware and operating system itself.

Solutions will be available in a separate files to avoid spoilers.

Feel free to contact me at pmarini72107@gmail.com or message me on slack (name: Marini) if you want to report a bug or leave a review, but please keep in mind that this is my first platformer game made for my first game jam in rudimentary framework such as Pygame (i did the best I could in less than two weeks    ðŸ˜­).

IMPORTANT: Game may be interpreted as a virus because of the interaction with the Windows API.  
Used Github Copilot a bit to guide me in the right direction to avoid having to look through hundreds of pages of documentation of the Windows API.
